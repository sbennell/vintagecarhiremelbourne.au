## Welcome to Always Classic Cars
We are a family-owned business with over 40 years of chauffeuring experience, founded by the late Tom Roberts. Our fleet is fully owned and operated by Always Classic Cars, with all chauffeurs licensed under Safe Transport Victoria and Commercial Passenger Vehicles Victoria. We carry $20 million in public liability insurance, fully covered by the Cursio Group.

### Location
You’ll find us at **360 Elgar Rd, Box Hill, VIC 3128**, near the corner of Standard Avenue, opposite Windsor Crescent. Our full collection of classic cars is on-site and available for viewing by appointment.

### Our Collection
We proudly offer over 25 vintage and classic vehicles, including the largest selection of Rolls-Royce cars in Victoria, all preserved to the highest standard. Our fleet features cars in black, white, silver, and a two-tone black and grey.

### Viewing
We highly recommend visiting our showroom to experience the vehicles firsthand, which allows you to assess comfort and ensure accommodation for your bridal gown and other details. **Viewings are by appointment and available 7 days a week**:
- **Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday**: 9:00 am - 7:00 pm
- **Other weekdays**: until 6:00 pm
- **Weekends**: 9:00 am - 12:00 pm

### How to Book
To secure your vehicle, please complete our online booking form promptly. A non-refundable but transferable deposit of $100 per car is required. Cancellations must be made **30 days prior** to the wedding to avoid forfeiture of the full payment.

We do not offer credit card facilities. Payments can be made via our Always Classic Cars Account (BSB: 633 000, Account: 3026317). Be sure to reference your name and wedding date. The remaining balance must be paid **at least 7 days** before the wedding, either by bank transfer or in cash to the chauffeur on the event day. Additional hire time is charged at **$75 per 15 minutes per car**.

### What We Provide
- Fully uniformed chauffeurs
- Wedding ribbon and lace on the back parcel shelf
- Red carpet service
- Champagne glasses, water, and umbrellas
- One bottle of Moscato or non-alcoholic apple cider per booking
- Chauffeurs will always open and close doors for passengers

### More Information
To ensure a smooth experience, we advise providing as much detail as possible on your booking form. It’s also helpful to designate a contact person other than the bridal couple for the day. We’ll confirm final details with you a few weeks before the wedding.

### Prices
We provide transparent, upfront pricing tailored to your specific needs. Once your package is confirmed, the hire duration cannot be shortened. A minimum hire period of **3 hours** applies, with all prices inclusive of GST. Travel fees may apply for longer distances, and a surcharge is applicable for bookings on public holidays.

### Night Transfers
Night transfers are based on a one-hour hire. If additional time is required, please inform us in advance. Extra time is charged at **$75 for every 15 minutes**. Signatures and recorded times are necessary to finalize the invoice. An additional $75 fee applies for pickups after midnight.
